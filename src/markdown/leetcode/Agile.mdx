## Exam Topics
- When should we apply [[Agile]]?
	- When change is expected and requirements are not fully defined upfront
- What should we do when we are on a time constraint? Should we limit functionality or extend the deadline? What shouldn't we do?
	- We should prioritize limiting functionality to meet the deadline. We shouldn't delay and we shouldn't add more developers. 
- How would we shorten time to market?
	- Reduce functionality
- What is [[Agile No Big Upfront]]? What is your opinion on it? What is traditional? What is ad hoc? What is [[Agile]]? Describe your own experiences?
- ==What is the ping pong ball video? What about flow? What about optimization?== 
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CostXs2p6r0
	- Highlights that maximum resource utilization may be detrimental to productivity by using a ping pong ball analogy
	- Pushing 
		- This means providing or 'pushing' work onto people. Pushing work onto people can limit flow and increase WIP. 
		- The individual should prioritize which tasks to complete
	- Pull
		- This means pulling work whenever ready. In this case (pull case), the backlog is already priotized. 
		- The individual does not need to prioritize items in the backlog,.
	- Focus on flow through pull 
- What is the[[ Customer Relationship]]? How is this used in [[XP (Xtreme Programming)]]? 
	- If there is no customer we should have a customer representative
	- Provide the product to potential customer to collect feedback and carefully consider the customer's feedback. (Note the example with Nokia and bigger buttons while iPhone implemented the touch screen)
- ==Know the [[Kano Model]]==
- Know[[ Self Organization]] (Motivation and sustainable pace for the employees)
- Know [[Additive Complexity]] and[[ Multiplicative Complexity]]. Compare and Contrast
	- Additive Complexity means that additional complexity proportionally increased the total complexity (layering)
	- Multiplicative Complexity means that additional complexity may not be proportional. Multiplicative Complexity requires some amount of Upfront thinking

	- [[Agile Capacity]] is how fast in days / hours
	- [[Agile Velocity]] is relative comparison (20 sp in a sprint). Story Points are not an absolute measure like days / hours
